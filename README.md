# ComputationalPhysics
I am a keen physics student, interested in theoretical aspects of physics especially in implementing numerical approaches to physical phenomena.
I am passionate to learn, and a fast learner. I have remarkable teaching skills which I have developed during my undergrad experience at KFUPM.
